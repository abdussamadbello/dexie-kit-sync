## Code Style

- Use TypeScript for all code
- Follow existing code style (enforced by ESLint and Prettier)
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Write tests for new features

## Changesets

This project uses [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) for version management and changelog generation.

### When to create a changeset:

- **Bug fixes** (patch): Create a changeset with type "patch"
- **New features** (minor): Create a changeset with type "minor"  
- **Breaking changes** (major): Create a changeset with type "major"
- **Documentation only**: No changeset needed
- **Tests only**: No changeset needed

### How to create a changeset:

```bash
npm run changeset
```

Follow the prompts to describe your changes. The changeset file should be committed with your PR.

For more details, see [PUBLISHING.md](./PUBLISHING.md).

## Testing

- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Ensure existing tests still pass
- Test files should be placed in the `test/` directory
- Use Vitest for testing

## Commit Messages

- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Start with a verb (Add, Fix, Update, Remove, etc.)
- Keep the first line under 72 characters
- Add more details in the commit body if needed

Example:
```
Add support for custom pagination strategies

- Implement cursor-based pagination
- Add offset-based pagination
- Update documentation with examples
```

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused on a single feature or fix
- Update documentation if needed
- Add tests for new functionality
- Ensure all CI checks pass
- Link related issues
